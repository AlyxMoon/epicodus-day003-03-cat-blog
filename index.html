  <h1>All About Cat</h1>

  <p>
    I am a cat. I like to meow and eat. Sometimes I try both and it hurts. What's a cat gonna do though?
  </p>

  <h2>Who am I</h2>

  <p>
    My name is Mr. Whiskers. Most know me as Mr. Meow however, for that is what I do. 
  </p>

  <h2>What I eat</h2>

  <p>
    Anything I can, especially if you do not want me to eat it. Also:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Plants you bring in the house</li>
    <li>Your socks</li>
    <li>Right of your plate! Hah, gotcha!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I do</h2>

  <p>I like to knock stuff off of tables.</p>
